I did however enjoy understanding concepts and especially the process of learning to understand them. Over the course of my studies and professional path I've found technology and specifically programming to be one of the most, if perhaps not the most, efficient way of implementing and affecting change – regardless of the working domain.</p><p>As a developer I cannot help but continue to yearn about learning as well as help others in their learning. I truly and passionately believe that software development as a craft has to incorporate this aspect for it, and its practitioners, to flourish. To little surprise I've found myself gravitating toward the educational domain where I believe that technology still has ample room to provide drastic change for the better, on a societal scale. My toolbox for attempting to achieve this lofty dream has its origins in web development, Java and subsequently basically anything I've managed to get my hands on. I'm a firm proponent for developers having many different tools in their belt.</p><p>As a person I am thoroughly interested in all things tech. But when I'm not thinking or working with tech, you will usually find me somewhere completely different: Either cooking, listening to music, reading, working on my house (and pretending to know what I'm doing) or laughing (I'm a Monty Python nut).

      "<p>A couple of years ago, I googled my name for fun.</p><p>Way back in the results I found some long-forgotten gems that I posted from my dialup connection to the alt.www.webmaster group on USENET. They were about HTML, and even one post was about the then just invented language Javascript. I was about 12 or 13 and the Internet had started to gain mainstream momentum. The dot-com bubble was building up. It would burst in March 2000, and I would give up on programming long before that, I just didn't know that while writing those posts.</p><p>It felt like I had to wait a million years to get computer access at home. To stand the waiting, I started collecting computer magazines, bringing the attached floppies and later CD-ROM's over to friends with computers to see what they contained. These magazines also used to provide simple guides on various topics, one of those happened to be HTML. I had to memorize the tags so that I could test them out by entering them in notepad.exe on the demo systems at my local Lap Power dealership.</p><p>I was 11 when I got my hands on a screaming fast multi media monster (Pentium MMX) at home, a year later, a Telia 020 dialup connection completed the setup. It gave me everything I ever wished for. At this point, I knew very well how to abuse the <marquee> HTML tag and quickly managed to set up Geocities hosting.</marquee></p><p>The Internet was very different back then. It provided me with a safe space during my years in secondary school. I even OP'd a successful channel on DALnet during those years. I never really got the hang of how the Perl scripts on Matt's Script Archive worked or what Dim meant in Visual Basic. I wanted to, but my interest had already started to shift to movie making.</p><p>In my later teens, I tried my best preparing for a career in film making. It proved to be difficult, being based in a small town far away from the industry didn't exactly help. To me, it made little sense to move just to Stockholm. If relocation was going to be required, why not move even further away. That's how I ended up in the Netherlands and how I began my exploration of north-west Europe. Brussels, Belgium was to follow, and before finally ending up in Stockholm, I spent ten years in Hamburg, Germany.</p><p>I think it was in the Netherlands that I got my first VPS, I was a bit afraid at first, as it didn't come with a full-blown desktop environment that I had come to expect from my time using Red Hat Linux 5.2 (not REHL, much older). I slowly started to figure out how the command line worked, and with time people would actually pay me to do system administration for them. One thing bothered me, though, while I was confident in configure and run applications, I could still not fully understand how something was working by reading its source code.</p><p>After doing Sysadmin, I developed a passion for programming. I remember, for years, all I did was study programming. I lived and breathed programming. I didn't even follow the news during these years, it's as if they didn't exist.</p><p>I now work as a Devops, making good use of the experiences that led me to this position.</p>   ",

      "<p>Innovation and the willingness to learn new things has always interested me. If you add to that the freedom of working seamlessly wherever you are, and seeing instant results of your labour, then the choice for me was easy I decided very early on that I wanted to program towards the web. That choice has lead me to visit many different places and meet many interesting people all over the world; from Geneva to Cape Town, passing through Barcelona and of course Malmö along the way. During my almost 14 years of experience in the field, I’ve seen how trends in web development come and go. </p><p>I started my professional career at the United Nations with a case study of workflows within Content Management Systems, and I was quickly drawn to the .NET environments and how the architectural concepts went through all layers of a CMS. As the web evolved so did I; Visual Studio, C# andMSSQL all quickly became standard tools in my developer toolbox. Later I also acquired an EpIServer CMS certificate and moved forward with more complex architectures.</p><p>In 2008 I moved to Cape Town, South Africa and decided to try and make a change in people's day-to-day lives by offering my services for free to local grassroots organizations. After doing this for almost 2 years, I started work with an EpiServer partner and dug further into the .NET world including REST APIs and Web Services. I did stay a bit longer than intended in South Africa as I met my wife there and we now share 2 beautiful kids that take up most of my free time. </p><p>In 2015 I jumped on the cloud wagon and started developing cloud applications in both Amazon AWS and Microsoft Azure. I still do small applications, but usually deal with bigger architectural solutions. </p><p>If there is one thing my journey has taught me, it is that the only constant in this field - as in life - is change, and therein lies the need to keep on moving forward. I love what I do.</p>   ",

Since almost no one around played chess, my only opportunities to play and get better were my grandfather, and my father. When I joined primary school I’ve started playing in various tournaments, joined a few state-wide ones, and even participated in a European championship. I was always fascinated by how simple and at the same time complex chess can be. This motivates me to find and implement simple solutions for complex problems. </p> <p>Through experimenting and solving different problems during my studies and personal/professional projects, I had the opportunity to work with C&#35;, Java, Python, PHP, different flavours of SQL and some scripting in PowerShell, and Bash. Even though I’ve worked with both, I’ve always preferred backend to frontend development. Currently I feel most comfortable working with, and navigating the world of Javascript. Apart from designing and implementing business features, I’ve always enjoyed automating and improving processes, as well as sharing knowledge on every step.</p> <p>Apart from work, I’m always trying to improve myself or learn about new things. That can range from playing with a Raspberry Pi to solving a 6x6 Rubik’s cube, or even learning Russian. I also enjoy reading, solving puzzle games, playing chess and video games. I love trips to nature, especially the mountains. I cannot describe with words the special feeling of peace and freedom when you’re surrounded by gigantic rock formations. To recharge my batteries I also like to climb in a nearby bouldering gym, go for a run, spend time with friends/family and sometimes play badminton.</p> <p>I love the idea of living life much like a Fibonacci spiral - constantly growing and spiralling out, exploring and reaching toward the unknown.</p>   ",

Luckily, my understanding of software development has improved a lot since then - and so have the tools.</p><p>​An amazing thing about the area of software development is that it never stops evolving. Promising technologies emerge frequently, while others fade away just as quickly as they arrive. Staying on top of things is certainly challenging, but equally rewarding, and helps developers such as myself to create exciting products. However, building high quality software depends on more than just technical knowledge, and requires social skills as well. It\'s the collaboration between a good mix of team members that really makes the software come alive.</p><p>In my spare time, I like travelling and spending time with my lovely family.

I found myself so insecure about committing my code changes that I could barely bring myself to do it! What if I broke something? What if I missed something? I had learned about TDD at school but this workplace had virtually no tests. So I convinced my Scrum master that adding tests would ease on-boarding and make new developers get accustomed more quickly. That was the sell. But the effect was immediate. Within 3 weeks there were nearly 400 tests in the test framework I'd set up from our 10 man team. Everyone was writing tests all of a sudden. Bugs were flushed out much sooner. Bug tickets stopped piling up. We started pushing out features at a much faster pace with much more confidence.</p><p>Ever since then my passion has been observing the dynamics of the software development process within a team and coming up with ideas to improve it.This has led me to roles like Scrum master, agile coaching and even TDD training as I feel like that is the foundation to building an empowered development team.</p><p>In my spare time you'll find me with my family or out with friends and being the 80's kid that I am, I'm a big fan of all things retro in computers and games.</p> ",

      "<p>I have always been a person of curiosity and being brought up in a family of engineers and ITprofessionals made it quite obvious for me to go down for a stroll in the land of computers.</p><p> Back when I used to be a kid, most of my time was spent interacting with gadgets and devices, playing 8-bitgames on ATARI, using the good old INTEL P4 system for learning how to type fast, create static HTMLpages, and other silly/fun stuff. Fast forward to my 20s, I took my passion for the computers and hardware to next level, when I became a reviewer and started my own blog/website where I used to write articles/reviews for computer hardware and gadgets sent to me by companies all around the globe. Since my daily life was revolving around computers, I decided to make it my career by doing adegree in computer sciences and started my professional journey in the field of software development. For most of my time in this field, I have worked as full stack developer. I have been working in different capacities and various companies ranging from the corporate sector to startups and as a freelanceconsultant. My main magic tools are .NET and Angular, but also have a couple of other cool stuff hiddenin my backpack as well. In this field of vast knowledge, you can always learn new stuff every day and I am never hesitant to try out new things and add to my skill tree. That’s what keeps me on my toes andup and running. </p><p>Joining Tretton37 is one of the best moments of my life. I was very gratified to see the extended support and warm welcome to the organization. Tretton37 is not your ordinary software consultancy company, I can surely bet on this. On my first day, I got an awesome reception from everyone here and a few hours later I was a part of the family. Amazing people, intellectuals, and wizards of IT all around the place. Last but not the least, remember I mentioned playing games when I was a little kid. I brought that traitwith me up till now, I am also an avid e-gamer.</p><p> Whenever I get free time, I play online games with my friends on Steam, Battle.net, and other e-sports platforms. Besides this, I also love to play Ping-Pong,watch TV series, go on long walks, hang out and dine out with my family.</p>   ",

      "<p>In my early childhood, I wanted to be an inventor. I have always loved playing construction sets and engineering toys. There were always not enough components to build something special, something out of the box. As a schoolboy, I read all the books in my local library about the technical details of steam engines, airplanes, rockets, robots, and more. When I was in 6th grade, I discovered a missing component. It was a computer. I immediately realized how valuable computers can be in my passion for invention. </p><p>I decided to learn as much as possible about computers and programming.Thanks to my parents, they very soon noticed my craving for computers. They bought me a 48K ZX Spectrum, then an i486, then a Celeron. I started learning programming with Basic, Asm, Pascal, then switched to C/C++. I spent nights disassembling and reverse engineering applications and video games in attempt to figure out how they were made.</p><p>Time has passed, I still have the same kid-ish curiosity and the same desire to explore and learn new things and make something special.These are still my main driving forces. When I find something attractive, I lose track of time digging into it down to its roots.</p><p>At the beginning of my IT career, I was a game developer. I have dealt with all aspects of the game development industry such as graphics design, sound design, level design, game features design, and of course programming, scripting, and testing. </p><p>I have learned a lot and got an unforgettable experience working for 8 years in the game industry.In 2009, I decided to shift the focus of my career to software development, I was looking for something related to the Internet.Then I discovered an endless ocean of different technology stacks and approaches in web application development.Now I am a full-stack developer. I prefer to work on the server-side. I can work with .NET and NodeJS stack. In terms of frontend development, I have experience writing applications using React and pure JavaScript. </p><p>I would like to advance my knowledge and skills towards system design, microservices, cloud solutions, high loads, and especially in the direction of web application security.I am eager to master new tools and technologies and apply them in practice. I firmly believe if one wants to be competitive, they need to constantly learn.I find pleasure in preventing and solving complex problems. I love the feeling when I see the results of work done that are useful for people or companies. When a new version that you have been developing for long time goes live and it works as expected, this brings unforgettable satisfaction with what has been done.I really appreciate the opportunity to be a member of the leet family at Tretton37.</p><p> I look forward to expanding and applying my experience, as well as my ambitions and potential, to help companies meet their business needs. I am delighted to meet and work with all these talented creative people, who share the same mindset as me.</p><p>I like spending my spare time with my family and friends. When I need to unload my brain and temporarily get rid of the thought of projects and work, I prefer to re-energize in nature. Traveling, hiking, cycling, and sailing help me quite well. I like many different outdoor and indoor activities. I am always open to trying something new. I like playing board games as well as video games. I play chess.</p>  ",

I quickly started a journey on trying to find out what werethe inner workings under the hood, and still today, I find myself making the same questionson every piece of technology I get my hands on.</p><p>Even though I started my college studies in chemistry, I kept my curiosity for computers as a \"hobby\".After a couple of years, I decided to drop chemistry and started studying on my \"hobby\", It all wentreally fast and smooth since then. Every class I had I used to ask myself when am I gonna use this?I was eager to play with hardware interfaces, and still today, I'm attracted a lot to low-levelcoding.</p><p>I've been working on different sectors and found out that no matter what you do on each, there area lot of exciting things to do and to solve. Imagination is the madness of the house, but it's funny and can lead to the opportunity to take out any dream to reality.</p><p>I'm a very chatty guy, enjoy listening to music, and eating out.For me, the greatest pleasure of all is to have the opportunity to show the world to my two little kids,maybe with old-fashioned 80's stuff, maybe because that's what my inner child is made of,but always looking for their happiness.</p>  ",

So when my parents weren’t at home I was carefully turning all the knobs and later returning them to the original position. I remember how it felt to turn those high-quality knobs and press the buttons and how the feeling was different than on any other radio I’ve ever played with before.</p><p>I’ve got the first computer at a relatively late age of 12 and of course, the first thing I asked my dad was to install some video games. It wasn’t until 14 that I started coding very basic static HTML pages, but then I was hooked right away. This lead to my first paid gigs, designing and coding Wordpress themes. I got super excited about hardware some years later and I worked as an Apple service technician for a few years. But in the end, software won the race when I got the opportunity to transition into QA and realised this is what I was meant to do.</p><p>I still find a lot of love in discovering new hardware and software technologies. I’m always tinkering with my multiple Raspberry Pi’s and talking about new tech in my podcast. I also spend a *censored* amount of time playing video games through multiple platforms. But I also get out from time to time to explore the world, traveling with my wife.</p> ",

If I have learned anything from it, it’s the following: almost any problem can be divided into smaller parts and solved in a simple manner. I started out with Python, which is still my language of choice when I have to make something simple or to explain a concept in programming.

I went off to study about book bindings, package design and print. That\'s where I got a sense about what function design actually is, and what it takes to make it an experience of pure craftsmanship. I noticed a lack of computer knowledge during my studies, so I continued to explore computers on my own.</p><p>This helped me to achieve something that I had in my mind both faster and easier. I continued my search through package design, graphic design, industrial design, motion, photography, production, scripts and landed in digital product design with a lot of baggage. </p><p>My main philosophy is "less is more" and, if I\'m honest, it\'s something I struggle to achieve in my daily life. Being aware that the simplest solution can be produced from a complex process, I try to consult with experts, explore all the possible options and take the time - and patience - with the product to design the best solution and never be a solo player. I believe problem solving with design thinking is a great tool we invented in 20th century. I also love the unknown, so I am always on a quest for knowledge and am prepared to share both my mistakes and good examples.</p><p>My free time consists of family time, sport, friends, and multiple hobbies.

      "<p> I grew up in a small village where most people preferred pen to paper than anything with a mouse or a keyboard. That is why I quickly became known as the guy who can fix your computer even though mostly I just had to turn it off and on again. What made me fall in love with computers was the idea that there are some things technology can do for and instead of me! To my six-years-old mind that was the closest thing to magic. My parents used to punish me for things I did or did't do by taking my power supply cable and I was convinced I was the smartest person in the world when I secretly bought another one and hid it under my bed to be used whenever I was being punished. So I guess you could say that computers have always been my partners in crime. </p> <p>When I run into a problem, I try to focus all my energy towards solving that problem. Then, after a while, I let go of everything and let my thoughts wander while I do other things, like sweat my a off on my bike. Usually that helps me find the solution to my problem. It usually hits me suddenly, just when I am about to slowly die, trying to climb some 18  hill, or when I am negotiating with my wife about whose turn it is to take out the doggo. </p> <p>That is what I love about my life – finding smart ways of solving a problem while doing things I love.

      "<p>My interest for computers started at the age of seven when my mother brought a computer from work to our home. I was hooked. According to my parents I was too hooked, so they tried to limit the time I was allowed to sit in front of that computer. In order to get me outdoors, they bought me a skateboard. Luckely for them, I really fell in love with the skateboard as well (and my mom started to worry about physical damages instead).</p><p>Honestly, I never questioned what to do in life, I just continued to explore the world of one &amp; zeros. Later in life I became more and more interested in how the machine, which was running my code, actually worked. I started to study electronics and computer science, which led me to embedded systems. But when I left the university I realised I wanted to use my new low level knowledge to gain my skills on the higher level. I have travelled the stack from south to north and today I feel totally at home as a front-end developer, with a full stack experience.</p><p>When you don’t find me in front of my computer you’ll probably find me on a surfboard, reading an interesting book, hanging out with people I like, or exploring a new part of the world. I strongly believe that an open mind and curiosity is the key to an awesome experience of life.​</p>        ",

      "<p>Ever since my first contact with computer programming around 1979, when my older brother bought a Commodore PET 2001, I was pretty much hooked. During a long break when my brother moved away from home, my interests turned to comic book and stamp collecting; more common interests at the time. It wasn't until 2013 that I got around to selling my stamp collection at a great loss...</p><p>Anyhow it wasn't until I was able to convince my parents to buy a Commodore 64 with a gigantic 1541 disk drive that I got back into programming. Learning Basic was a natural first step, and I recall doing some performance comparisons between algorithms running Commodore Basic on C64 and Microsoft Basic on the Fat Mac. The lasting result of those years were a pretty cool joystick controlled labyrinth game. Those were the days, in the mid-80's.</p><p>After working hard as a janitor the summer of 1989, I could finally afford to get into the Amiga scene, where I stayed into the late 1990's, a time otherwise spent at the university with Solaris and Emacs. Around that time I, by chance, got a PC for free, a pretty huge old Pentium70 box.</p><p>From there I quickly got into the consulting business, finding the .NET framework late 2000, and have pretty much stayed there ever since. It's great fun and my long, diverse experience has proven useful when helping customers out with a wide variety of problems.</p><p>Outside of the computer business, my biggest interest at the moment (except my wife and kids, of course :)) is buying and selling things or derivatives of things, and trying to turn a profit.</p> ",

Instead, facilitate and protect the team.As a Tech Lead - Don't go all solo. Instead, Utilize team skills and make sure everyone in the team is part of the journey.As a Developer - Don't just code and focus on the technical stuff. Instead, make sure to also understand the business needs and goals.</p><p>In my spare time, I like to challenge my MIDI-keyboard, write songs or play the guitar. And sometimes I blow the dust away from Unreal Engine and do some happy coding in C++. It all depends on the mood.</p>  ",

      "<p>My interest for computer programming and software development started back in the mid-80’s, when I acquired my first computer - a used Commodore 64. All my friends were heavily into playing computer games at that time, but since I proved to be a pretty crappy gamer, I started to explore programming instead, and have not stopped since.</p><p>I immediately fell in love with the way I could be creative and playful, learn things and challenge myself at the same time. Pretty quickly I got involved in the so-called demo scene (a sub culture for showing off your artistic and programming skills) and started to create so-called computer demos with my team, competing against others teams at demo parties. Our team consisted of people from all over Sweden, and even other countries. In retrospect I realise that, as young teenagers we were working on projects together in self-organising distributed teams. We were using the ways of remote communication available at the time, which was the telephone, letters with floppies and sometimes modems. All of this gave me some really valuable lessons that proved to be essential throughout my work life. What happened to the demo scene and the team? Well, we are still doing things together, on Commodore 64, Amiga and other retro platforms, going to demo parties and competing with other teams.</p><p>Working with software engineering gives me a perfect mix of creativity and structure. The feeling when you create something of value with your team, or solve a complex problem together is awesome. I believe strongly in the ability of people working together in a playful manner, to make bits and bytes come to life. It gives me a great feeling when I see people helping each other out and learning together. To coach people to learn, explore and push their abilities further is something I want to dive deeper into in the future.</p><p>Outside of the office, I enjoy spending as much time as I can with my wife and daughter, meeting friends, and occasionally enjoying a good run. And of course, retro coding.</p>  ",

Loving anything that had to do with computers.</p><p>Another jump forward to 1999. In the midst of having tried many different jobs, I got the chance to study a short course in "web-design". I turned that into a job in an advertising firm located in Copenhagen working in the interactive department. I worked there for about four and a half years doing everything from web-development with html, javascript, css and flash to editing sound and video.</p><p>As my time was coming to an end at the advertising firm I knew I wanted to go deeper into development. But not finding any courses I studied system administration instead.

I get so much inspiration and energy from my team, not to mention all ideas that pop up when I am working with others; ideas that in most cases are not that good, but sometimes - after being discussed and scrutinized - actually can lead to new initiatives or new business!</p><p>I can be a bit impatient, which can be frustrating for my team. I try to listen more than I talk, even though I like attention and to state my opinion.</p><p>I have also started a company producing modular housing based on shipping containers, in a standardized industrial manner. This was a great product, but the market wasn’t ready for it… A key learning was that we were a bit heavy on the engineering side and less skilled on the marketing side.</p><p>What I have understood about myself is that I like to be in a developing environment where technology interacts with people and that I like to take the lead in helping solve problems and deliver great tech products!</p><p>On the private side I enjoy family life with four kids, spending time in our summer house, and when possible – to kitesurf and go skiing.</p>  ",

I often throw myself into new challenges and think that "All things are difficult before they are easy" is a great saying. I have a thing for details....small things that put the icing on the cake. I would say that service is my super power and I am happy to perform my service skills here at tretton37.</p><p>My family is of course my number 1 priority and travel is our passion. We are always planning that next trip. I am an enthusiastic sportsparent and I constantly chase my personal best at running a swedish mile. I like to be busy, surrounding myself with nice people and things to do. But I am also learning to enjoy the small things that brings you a happy life!</p>   ',
