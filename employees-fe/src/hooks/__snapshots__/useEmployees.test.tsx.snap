My experiences have been quite varied, from creating games to full blown web-based intranet platforms.</p><p>Because of this variation and these experiences I’ve found that I’ve acquired a thirst for front-end development and anything web related, which can range from mobile apps to web-based SaaS solutions. The fact that you can create ANYTHING with almost nothing is an exhilarating feeling. It’s one of the major reasons that keeps me going; the only limit is my imagination.</p><p>I absolutely love to travel and experience new cultures (and food!) when the opportunity presents itself. My goal in life is to visit as many places and experience as many different cultures as I possibly can. So far I can cross off Europe and half of Asia from my list, and I look forward to many more exciting adventures to come.</p>   \\",\\"gitHub\\":\\"AgronKabashi\\",\\"twitter\\":\\"_agronkabashi\\",\\"stackOverflow\\":null,\\"linkedIn\\":\\"/pub/agron-kabashi/54/6a8/4a6\\",\\"imagePortraitUrl\\":\\"https://i.1337co.de/profile/agron-kabashi\\",\\"imageWallOfLeetUrl\\":\\"https://i.1337co.de/wallofleet/agron-kabashi\\",\\"highlighted\\":false,\\"published\\":true,\\"primaryRole\\":null,\\"secondaryRole\\":null,\\"area\\":\\"Engineering\\"},{\\"name\\":\\"Ahmad Mirzaei\\",\\"email\\":\\"ahmad.mirzaei@1337.tech\\",\\"phoneNumber\\":\\"+46705133787\\",\\"office\\":\\"Lund\\",\\"manager\\":\\"sarah.thoren@1337.tech\\",\\"orgUnit\\":\\"/Employees\\",\\"mainText\\":\\"<p>It all started with my brother's projects from local businesses almost 8 years ago, when he was responsible for developing web interfaces for them.</p> <p>There was a time where he was struggling to handle multiple projects at the same time, so he encouraged me to join him in the journey. After completing some small projects - using simple UI designs - it became my passion.This passion drives me even up until this moment and it still makes me forget about the time as I focus on providing a better solution for the challenges that I’m facing all the time. Yes, this passion that I am talking about is like an engine inside me that would work without fuel, something infinite, only for one reason and that is I love what I do.</p> <p> I have always believed that Front-end development is a thing that I would love, because it always brings me some fresh challenges to think about, makes me use all my effort and thought in order to provide a better solution.Thinking about the years that have passed by so far - deep diving in heart of the front end technologies and finding out about all it’s nuts and bolts and filling out my days and nights with it - brings a smile to my face. This smile is because I can look at myself and know that I've been enjoying some of the best times of my life, and I’m really glad that I've chosen the right thing for rest of it.</p> <p>Tech life aside, in my spare time I always love to go biking, hiking, and love to walk or run. I’m not good at cooking but I actually love the experience of cooking when there are no options left (only for survival purpose). If I’m not doing one of those things, you would probably find me in Github’s explore page or in stack overflow helping some tech fellows.</p>   \\",\\"gitHub\\":\\"a-m-dev\\",\\"twitter\\":\\"a_m_dev\\",\\"stackOverflow\\":\\"5354341\\",\\"linkedIn\\":\\"/in/ahmad-mirzaei-b60b2618a/\\",\\"imagePortraitUrl\\":\\"https://i.1337co.de/profile/ahmad-mirzaei\\",\\"imageWallOfLeetUrl\\":\\"https://i.1337co.de/wallofleet/ahmad-mirzaei\\",\\"highlighted\\":false,\\"published\\":true,\\"primaryRole\\":null,\\"secondaryRole\\":null,\\"area\\":\\"Engineering\\"},{\\"name\\":\\"Ahmed Bazzara\\",\\"email\\":\\"ahmed.bazzara@1337.tech\\",\\"phoneNumber\\":\\"+46705133723\\",\\"office\\":\\"Lund\\",\\"manager\\":\\"andreas.nilsson@1337.tech\\",\\"orgUnit\\":\\"/Employees\\",\\"mainText\\":\\"<p>It started with a hedgehog, not just any hedgehog. Sonic The Hedgehog was 9 years old, I was five. Since then gaming and computers has been the most persistent distraction of my life. Despite this I’m a very social and outgoing creature who values the company of my friends highly.</p><p>It took me a while to find programming -were around 11 years old when I wrote my first program on VB-, but when I finally did, I realised that I’m totally hooked on the thought of creating, finding flaws and develop smart digital solutions. I keep chasing new knowledge in order to improve and I’m one of those who get truly satisfied when I can see the results of my work. </p><p>The last couple of years I’ve been struggling to find my way as a newbie in Sweden. Now when I’ve finally found it I feel ready to dive in to the world of programming for real. I like the thought diving and I’m actually also a quite dedicated swimmer in my spare time. Every now and then I love to marathon watch a really good TV-series and If I’m not inside you’ll find me camping in the nature. I haven’t got to do that much travelling the last couple of years, but the very second I get the opportunity I’ll be on an airplane ready to explore and fill my self with experiences.</p>   \\",\\"gitHub\\":\\"ticooo95\\",\\"twitter\\":null,\\"stackOverflow\\":null,\\"linkedIn\\":\\"/in/ahmed-bazzara/\\",\\"imagePortraitUrl\\":\\"https://i.1337co.de/profile/ahmed-bazzara\\",\\"imageWallOfLeetUrl\\":\\"https://i.1337co.de/wallofleet/ahmed-bazzara\\",\\"highlighted\\":false,\\"published\\":true,\\"primaryRole\\":null,\\"secondaryRole\\":null,\\"area\\":\\"Engineering\\"},{\\"name\\":\\"Akan Murat Cimen\\",\\"email\\":\\"akan.murat.cimen@1337.tech\\",\\"phoneNumber\\":\\"+46761337198\\",\\"office\\":\\"Lund\\",\\"manager\\":\\"jim@1337.tech\\",\\"orgUnit\\":\\"/Employees\\",\\"mainText\\":\\"<p>It has always been appealing to me to try to understand everything from the big bang to AI-suggested cat videos by asking the what, why, and how questions.

What I love about being a project manager and scrum master is the mutual sense of accomplishment when the team succeeds, and also the opportunity to overcome and learn from a variety of challenges along the way. I also enjoy coding where possible, exploring new technologies to provide me with inspiration and insights which could be applied in my work.</p><p>When I'm not working, I love playing the guitar (electric or acoustic depending on mood!), so let me know if you want to jam! I also enjoy keeping fit and have a new-found interest in cross-country skiing after moving to Sweden, and have since completed En Svensk Klassiker and 2 Vasalopp. Let's see what the next challenge will be!</p><p>As an Englishman I obviously enjoy a day of watching Premier League (Liverpool is my team), accompanied by a slightly warm ale. I also like good dose of British Comedy, such as The Office (UK), Alan Partridge, Hot Fuzz or Stewart Lee to name a few.
